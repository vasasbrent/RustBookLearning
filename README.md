Workspace for example work and offshoot ideas while reading through the big book of Rust

## Sections

### Hello There

* Special "main" function, drop hot here at execution, makes sense
  * Have not covered command line arguments/passing into main, soon to come hopefully

### Hello Cargo

* Cargo just straight up removes all the difficulties from project setup (C perspective)
* ` Cargo check ` assesses whether a build is possible without generating an .exe
  * Dumb quick, use for sus code repeatedly

### Guessing Game

Classic, Are you smarter than a CS161 student?
